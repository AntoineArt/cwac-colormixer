CWAC ColorMixer: Appealing To Your Users' Sense of Fashion
==========================================================
Sometimes, you want your users to pick a color. A simple
approach is to give the user a fixed roster of a handful
of colors -- easy, but limited. A fancy approach is to use
some form of color wheel, but these can be difficult to use
on a touchscreen and perhaps impossible without a touchscreen.

`ColorMixer` is a widget that provides a simple set of `SeekBars`
to let the user mix red, green, and blue to pick an arbitrary color.
It is not very big, so it is easy to fit on a form, and it is still
fairly finger-friendly.

It is also packaged as a dialog (`ColorMixerDialog`) and a
preference (`ColorPreference`).

This is available from [the Android Parcel Project](http://andparcel.com) as the
`cwac-colormixer` parcel.

Usage
-----
Full instructions for using this module are forthcoming. Stay

(though documentation on `ColorMixer` can also be found in [*The Busy Coder's
Guide to Advanced Android Development*](http://commonsware.com/AdvAndroid))

Dependencies
------------
This depends upon the `cwac-parcel` parcel for accessing
project-level resources.
